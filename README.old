ShoutVST is a VST that enables streaming sound into Icecast directly from VST hosts, ideal for streaming live performances directly from applications like Traktor or Ableton without the use of loopback methods.

## Usage ##
Just copy the .dll into your VST plugin direcory - your host application should be able to recognize it immediately. Open the plugin GUI to edit the options.

Get the Icecast server from http://www.icecast.org/ to enable streaming.

The VST supports both OGG and MP3 encoding - for MP3 to be available, copy lame\_enc.dll (e.g. from http://www.rarewares.org/mp3-lame-bundle.php ) in your VST directory.

## Current todos ##
  * Automatic update of mount file extension when switching encoder.
  * Save / Load settings from project file
  * Reset to default settings

### Possibilities ###
  * Some more encoding options (i.e. anything else than VBR)
  * Output volume setting (both for the stream and as a VST output)
  * MacOSX / Linux version - I'm willing to have amends to the source if someone helps me out.
